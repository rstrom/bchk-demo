In the next **policy rating** practice question, you will rate the aspect ***People not feeling anxious***.

Here is how to rate this aspect: If you feel that people in your nation are **feeling very anxious** you should give a **low** rating. If you feel that people are **not feeling very anxious** you should give a **high** rating.

When you make a **policy decision** about this aspect, note that if ***People not feeling anxious*** **increases**, this means people are feeling **less** anxious. If ***People not feeling anxious*** **decreases**, this means people are feeling **more** anxious.

All the aspects in this survey are worded so that most people would prefer more of the aspect to less of the aspect. So when you see an aspect like this that is about **not** having something undesirable, please think carefully about how to interpret the question.
