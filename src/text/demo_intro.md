## Overview

The survey consists of two types of questions. In the first type of question, we ask for ratings of various aspects of **your life** or the **lives people in your nation**, based on the past year (12 months). We call these questions **personal ratings** and **policy ratings**, respectively. In the second type of question, we elicit a choice between two options which would change some aspect of **your life**, or the **lives of people in your nation**, during the next year. We call these questions **personal decisions** and **policy decisions**, respectively.

The survey uses a repetitive design to learn as much as possible about the respondentâ€™s preferences. This demonstration version includes **personal ratings** and **personal decisions** for fifteen aspects of well-being:

1. how much you like your home (house or apartment)
2. you not being worried about money
3. you feeling your job is secure

5. your ability to take part in the political process in your nation
6. your physical safety and security
7. your knowledge, skills, and access to information
8. you feeling alive and full of energy
9. you having enough time for all the things that are most important to you
