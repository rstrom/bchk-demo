### Example

Here is another practice **policy rating** about a different aspect of the lives of people in your nation. Notice that the aspect **People not feeling anxious** includes the word “not.” So if you feel that people in your nation are **feeling very anxious** you should give a **low** rating. If you feel that people are **not feeling very anxious** you should give a **high** rating. Some of the other aspects you will see in this survey also include the word “not” or refer to the “absence of” something. Please think about these aspects carefully, like in this example.
