### Example

Here is another practice **personal rating** about a different aspect of your life. Please read and follow the instructions below. Notice that the aspect People not feeling anxious includes the word “not.” So if you feel that people in your nation are feeling very anxious you should give a low rating. If you feel that people are not feeling very anxious you should give a high rating. Some of the other aspects you will see in this survey also include the word “not” or refer to the “absence of” something. Please think about these aspects carefully, like in this example.
